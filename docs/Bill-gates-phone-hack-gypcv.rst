Bill Gates recently said that his 'greatest mistake ever' — reportedly worth $ billion — was to not create Android at Microsoft. A look at. When Gates was just years-old, he was caught hacking into a major corporation's computer and as a consequence he was forced to give up. In, Gates admitted the way he handled Microsoft's own mobile phone division was his "greatest mistake.". Graham Ivan Clark, of Florida, was 17 years old at the time of the hack in July, during which he took over a number of major accounts including those of Joe Biden, Bill Gates and Kim Kardashian West. Answer (1 of 3): Can you clarify this question? Do you mean which company makes his current mobile phone or do you mean does make a mobile phone? In the case of the former, I have no idea. There single phone starting in is the high end Surface Duo 2 which is a dual phone android powered phon.
