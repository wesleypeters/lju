    · I'm having an interesting problem. I see the card in Network Preferences and it shows up in ioreg explorer and system report. But I'm not able to turn wifi on (Clicking the Turn Wi-Fi on button does nothing). At one point, wifi was turned on, but it was not picking up any SSID. Now it show SSID asks for password, shows "Cannot Connect"User Interaction Count:  Remove the 2 screws on the bottom of the Auros wifi CNVi housing and remove the card. Disassemble the housing and disconnect the MHF4 connectors. Route the connectors out of the bottom of the housing. Re install the card, then mount the a/e to apple adapter onto the housing of the CNVi card and connect the cables. hey folks, I'm looking for wifi/bt card for my asrock x motherboard (ATX). It's got a m.2 key e slot for wifi/bt and I'm wondering if there are any cards for it that are known to work on a hackintosh. I'm also open to a pci-e card if that's better. Thanks!
