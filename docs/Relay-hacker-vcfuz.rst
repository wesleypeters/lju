When attackers try to relay NTLM blobs including signing negotiation flags to a protocol not supporting session signing (like LDAPS), the target server usually. The relay hack allows third parties to gain access to a car, but it does not allow them to gain control of one while someone else is driving. What if we could amplify and relay that signal from the key fob and fool the car that the owner is nearby? That is exactly what this hack does!

 · This keyless entry hack is probably one of the simplest out there. This follows a similar principle to “relays” which transmit an RFID signal across a longer distance. Keyless entry systems use a “handshake” signal that sends a signal .  · The relay hack allows third parties to gain access to a car, but it does not allow them to gain control of one while someone else is ted Reading Time: 2 mins. Thanks to the "multi-relay" feature, another attacker machine/interface can be added to the targets to combine ntlmrelayx with Responder servers. The attackers will be able capture an NTLM response with a custom challenge on an interface/machine, while relaying on another.
